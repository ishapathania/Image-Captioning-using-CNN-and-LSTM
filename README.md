# Image-Captioning-using-CNN-and-LSTM
This project utilizes the ‘Merge’ model architecture consisting of an encoder, sequence processor and a decoder, to generate captions for a given input image. We trained the model using different pre-trained CNNs to see which gave the best results and also varied the dropout rates for the best CNN model.
